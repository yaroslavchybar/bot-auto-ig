# Instagram Followers Scraper Suite - README

✨ Support Me :- https://buymeacoffee.com/kevdigishop

## 📌 Overview

This Instagram Followers Scraper Suite is a Python-based toolset designed to extract follower and following data from Instagram profiles. The suite includes three main modules:

1. **Session Manager** - Handles Instagram session authentication
2. **Follower Scraper** - Extracts follower data from target profiles
3. **Following Scraper** - Extracts following data from target profiles

The tool uses Instagram's private API endpoints with proper session authentication to gather data efficiently while implementing rate limiting to avoid detection.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-module architecture** for organized functionality
- **Session management** for persistent authentication
- **Customizable scraping limits** (number of users to scrape)
- **JSON output** for easy data processing
- **Colorful console interface** with progress indicators
- **Rate limiting** to avoid detection
- **Randomized user agents** to mimic organic traffic
- **Duplicate filtering** in output data

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**: The tool implements random delays between requests to avoid triggering Instagram's rate limits. Do not modify these delays to be more aggressive.

2. **Legal Considerations**: 
   - This tool is for educational purposes only
   - Scraping may violate Instagram's Terms of Service
   - Use responsibly and respect privacy laws in your jurisdiction

3. **Session Authentication**: 
   - You must provide a valid Instagram session ID
   - Sessions may expire and need to be refreshed periodically

4. **Verified Accounts**: The tool may not be able to scrape more than 50 followers/following for verified accounts due to Instagram's API limitations.

## 📝 Example Usage

### Scraping Followers

1. Run `python main.py`
2. Select option `2` for Follower Scraper
3. Enter the target username when prompted
4. Specify the number of followers to scrape (or 0 for all)
5. View progress in the console
6. Find results in `FOLLOWERS DATA/[username]/followers.json`

### Output Format

The JSON output contains detailed user information for each follower/following:

```json
[
  {
    "pk": "123456789",
    "username": "example_user",
    "full_name": "Example User",
    "is_private": false,
    "profile_pic_url": "https://...",
    "is_verified": false
  },
  ...
]
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Error: Status code 403"
- Solution: Your session ID may have expired. Generate a new one using the Session Manager.

**Issue**: "Can't scrape more than 50 followers"
- Solution: The target account is likely verified. Instagram limits data for verified accounts.

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError"
- Solution: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
